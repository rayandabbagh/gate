# Gate - Production Ready

## Overview

Gate is a production-ready AI agent team that stops production bugs before they reach your users. Each commit is analyzed by specialized AI agents that autonomously generate tests, run simulations, and check for regressions.

## How Agents Work

### 1. Agents Read Commit Diffs
Each agent starts by reading the commit diffs to understand what changed in the commit.

### 2. Agents Understand Full Codebase Context
Agents use LLM (Gemini) to understand the role of the commit in the context of the entire codebase:
- What the commit does
- What areas might be affected
- What needs to be tested/checked

### 3. Agents Autonomously Generate Work
Based on understanding, each agent **autonomously generates** its own tests, simulations, or checks:

- **Regression Agent**: Generates regression tests and checks for risky changes
- **Test Generation Agent**: Autonomously generates unit/integration tests for changed code paths (using LLM when available)
- **E2E Simulation Agent**: Generates and executes realistic user flows
- **Shadow Comparison Agent**: Generates comparison tests for behavioral changes

### 4. Debug Bundle Generated for ANY Bug
When **ANY bug is caught** (even micro bugs), a comprehensive Debug Bundle is immediately generated with:
- Clear explanation of what bugs were caught
- Pre-production warning
- Full context for coding agents
- Reproduction steps
- How to fix each bug

## Key Features

✅ **Autonomous Test Generation**: All tests are generated by agents/LLMs - no pre-written tests  
✅ **Full Codebase Context**: Agents understand entire repository, not just diffs  
✅ **LLM-Enhanced**: Uses Gemini AI for intelligent code analysis (when API key configured)  
✅ **Catches ALL Bugs**: Even micro bugs trigger Debug Bundle generation  
✅ **Production Ready**: Professional UI, robust error handling, comprehensive logging  

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
cd gate-project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Add Gemini API Key** (recommended):
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. **Start Server**:
```bash
./start.sh
```

4. **Use UI**: Open `frontend/index.html` in browser

## Agent Capabilities

### Test Generation Agent

**Autonomously generates tests using LLM when available**:

1. Reads commit diffs
2. Uses LLM to understand what needs testing
3. Generates intelligent test cases for:
   - Normal operation
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling
   - Integration points
4. Creates test files with generated code

**Without LLM**: Uses AST analysis to generate test templates  
**With LLM**: Generates intelligent, context-aware tests

### All Agents

- Read commit diffs first
- Understand changes in full codebase context
- Autonomously generate work (tests/simulations/checks)
- Show exactly what they did and why

## Debug Bundle

The Debug Bundle is **always generated** when ANY bugs are found (even micro bugs). It includes:

1. **What Bugs Were Caught**: Clear explanation of each bug
2. **Pre-Production Warning**: Alerts about bugs before production
3. **Full Context**: Codebase scope, agent reasoning, logs
4. **How to Fix**: Actionable instructions for each bug
5. **Ready for Coding Agents**: Optimized format for Cursor, Claude, Copilot, OpenAI

## Production Features

- **Professional UI**: Clean, modern design with smooth animations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
- **Commit-Specific**: Each analysis tied to specific commit SHA
- **Full Transparency**: Shows exactly what each agent did

## Architecture

```
Commit Diff → Full Codebase Context → LLM Understanding → Autonomous Test Generation
                                                           ↓
                                              Debug Bundle (if bugs found)
```

All tests are generated by agents/LLMs - no static test files. Agents proof-test each commit before it reaches production.

## Next Steps

1. Add your Gemini API key for LLM-enhanced analysis
2. Configure for your CI/CD pipeline
3. Connect to your GitHub repositories
4. Let agents proof-test every commit before production
